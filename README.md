# StemWarriorHacksFall2021-Reconnect
Reconnect is a website geared toward helping people rediscover nature. On it, we map out local nature sites using the Javascript Maps API, and we implemented an incentive system for users to earn points and win gift cards. This was created by Jennifer Chiou and Mudit Marwaha for the STEMWarriorHacks 2021 Fall hackathon.
